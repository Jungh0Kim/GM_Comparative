Comparative study_GM v1.0
========

Matlab code for comparative study of structural seismic responses using recorded and synthetic ground motions, from:

Kim, J., Su, M., Wang, Z., & Broccardo, M. (2025). Recorded Versus Synthetic Ground Motions: A Comparative Analysis of Structural Seismic Responses. arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.19549.
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.19549.

How to Run:
 - Download synthetic_GM dataset: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/otdcwmh2w6oqkqm3ews43/GeneratedGM_2000.mat?rlkey=6yej9zkno0ufhbhar8a837y6r&st=tljir3jr&dl=0
 - Download recorded_GM dataset: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/r7fmazb3393xwxr9ckj2t/SelectedGM_2000.mat?rlkey=ttnlf99ysck7tcv7lj2ly771d&st=9wanksiq&dl=0
   Note: For the recorded_GM dataset, RSN identifiers and scaling factors are provided in Excel format. You may wish to download the acceleration histories directly from the PEER NGA-West2 database(https://peer.berkeley.edu/).
 - Run main files to reproduce the results
